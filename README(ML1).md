# Machine Learning Classification On A Numeric Dataset Description

Expecting salaries based on various factors such as age, education level, years of experience, and gender. The project utilizes the Random Forest Regression algorithm and explores various data visualizations and insights before building the model.


## Key Highlights

1. Preprocessing the data by handling missing values, duplicates, and encoding categorical features.
2. Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between variables and identify potential patterns.
3. Building a Random Forest Regression model and evaluating its performance using cross-validation and R-squared score.
4. Data visualization and visualizing the model's expectations and comparing them to the actual salaries.


## Libraries Used

1. Pandas
2. NumPy
3. Plotly
4. Scikit-learn
5. warnings
